Git Basics
==========

A basic overview of [Git](http://git-scm.com) accompanied by some tips,
tricks, and opinions on workflow for using it each day. This is no way
attempts to be a complete guide, just a simple set of heuristics to help
out beginners new to Git.

I personally learned Git best by watching Scott Chacon's
[videos](http://blip.tv/scott-chacon), reading through [Git's
documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation), and browsing through
Chacon's [Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book). Remember, [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/git/) is your friend, as well.
